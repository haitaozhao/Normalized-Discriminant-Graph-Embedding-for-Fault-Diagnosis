# Normalized Discriminan Graph Embedding for Fault Diagnosis


- Code for paper "Normalized Discriminant Graph Embedding for Fault Diagnosis"
- Unzip the dataset file "TE_dataset.zip" in the same directory with the matlab files
- Run the code "NDGE_demo.m" or paste the code into the command window of matlab to run the code
- The demo is designed for the fault modes in Case 1.
- The outputs include the final projection matrix of NDGE, the accuracies of different dimensions, and the probabilities of each samples to different fault modes
- the plot of the accuracies of different dimensions will be obtained after the running of the code
- It should take less than 5 minutes to get the results. Note that the testing part is very fast. The training part is a little bit time consuming. The reason is that there are a lot of loops in the code which make matlab slow. the code will be optimized in the near future.
- If you have any commments please let me know. Thank you very much!
